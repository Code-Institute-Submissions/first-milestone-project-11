# Milestone Project 1 - Code institute Full stack software developer course
This project is a requirement of completing the code institue full stack software course. This is the first major project of the course and tests the skills gained to date using html, css, and bootstrap 4.

In this project we are required to build a website for a band.The requirements are as below:

    "Build a static (front-end only) website for a band. As a starting point, you may want to use wireframes, as we did in the UX lesson (you can use Balsamiq or any other tool, including just pen and paper). You can use either your assets or the assets within the following GitHub repo.
    The band is a 1960’s rock band and have around 50 years experience of performing live at numerous events around the world. You have been given the following requirements after interviews with the client’s representatives:
        Their primary target audiences are their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available.
        Also, the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.
    The band has provided you, the developer, with the following assets that they would like to showcase on their website:
        Photos of the band members
        A video clip
        Audio clips
    Also, they are in the process of creating a social media presence and would like to add links to their Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages."

# UX

I decided to go with a clean minimal interface, to allow users get the information the want with the with no more that 2 clicks. 

I based my colour palette on blue (/#45a29b and /#66fc) and black

I used the google font 'Margarine' as it was most similar to the original 'hobo' font used in the Monkees album covers.

### User types

My user type are as per below

    As a user i want to be able to view the latest event news on the Monkees
    
    As a user i want to be able to view images of the Monkees
    
    As a user i want to be able to view video of the Monkees
    
    As a user i want to be able to listen to some music tracks of the Monkees
    
    As a user i want to be able to submit my details to be contact in relation to news and events of the Monkees
    
### Wireframes
I have created wireframes of each page and they can be found in the /wireframes folder
